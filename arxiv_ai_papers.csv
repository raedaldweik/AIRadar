2509.13316v1,Do Natural Language Descriptions of Model Activations Convey Privileged Information?,Millicent Li; Alberto Mario Ceballos Arroyo; Giordano Rogers; Naomi Saphra; Byron C. Wallace,[Submitted on 16 Sep 2025],"Recent interpretability methods have proposed to translate LLM internal representations into natural language descriptions using a second verbalizer LLM. This is intended to illuminate how the target model represents and operates on inputs. But do such activation verbalization approaches actually provide privileged knowledge about the internal workings of the target model, or do they merely convey information about its inputs? We critically evaluate popular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that they succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals, suggesting that these datasets are not ideal for evaluating verbalization methods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations often reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated them, rather than the activations of the target LLM being decoded. Taken together, our results indicate a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental controls to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful insights into the operations of LLMs.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13316v1

Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability. Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly outperforms all open-source agents in complex information-seeking tasks, matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13305v1
2509.13298v1,QDFlow: A Python package for physics simulations of quantum dot devices,Donovan L. Buterakos; Sandesh S. Kalantre; Joshua Ziegler; Jacob M Taylor; Justyna P. Zwolak,[Submitted on 16 Sep 2025],"Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have accelerated progress in calibrating and operating quantum dot (QD) devices. However, most ML approaches rely on access to large, high-quality labeled datasets for training, benchmarking, and validation, with labels capturing key features in the data. Obtaining such datasets experimentally is challenging due to limited data availability and the labor-intensive nature of labeling. QDFlow is an open-source physics simulator for multi-QD arrays that generates realistic synthetic data with ground-truth labels. QDFlow combines a self-consistent Thomas-Fermi solver, a dynamic capacitance model, and flexible noise modules to produce charge stability diagrams and ray-based data closely resembling experiments. With extensive tunable parameters and customizable noise models, QDFlow supports the creation of large, diverse datasets for ML development, benchmarking, and quantum device research.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13298v1
2509.13294v1,Accelerating Protein Molecular Dynamics Simulation with DeepJump,Allan dos Santos Costa; Manvitha Ponnapati; Dana Rubin; Tess Smidt; Joseph Jacobson,[Submitted on 16 Sep 2025],"Unraveling the dynamical motions of biomolecules is essential for bridging their structure and function, yet it remains a major computational challenge. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation provides a detailed depiction of biomolecular motion, but its high-resolution temporal evolution comes at significant computational cost, limiting its applicability to timescales of biological relevance. Deep learning approaches have emerged as promising solutions to overcome these computational limitations by learning to predict long-timescale dynamics. However, generalizable kinetics models for proteins remain largely unexplored, and the fundamental limits of achievable acceleration while preserving dynamical accuracy are poorly understood. In this work, we fill this gap with DeepJump, an Euclidean-Equivariant Flow Matching-based model for predicting protein conformational dynamics across multiple temporal scales. We train DeepJump on trajectories of the diverse proteins of mdCATH, systematically studying our model's performance in generalizing to long-term dynamics of fast-folding proteins and characterizing the trade-off between computational acceleration and prediction accuracy. We demonstrate the application of DeepJump to ab initio folding, showcasing prediction of folding pathways and native states. Our results demonstrate that DeepJump achieves significant $\approx$1000$\times$ computational acceleration while effectively recovering long-timescale dynamics, providing a stepping stone for enabling routine simulation of proteins.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13294v1
2509.13288v1,Shapes of Cognition for Computational Cognitive Modeling,Marjorie McShane; Sergei Nirenburg; Sanjay Oruganti; Jesse English,[Submitted on 16 Sep 2025],"Shapes of cognition is a new conceptual paradigm for the computational cognitive modeling of Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents (LEIAs). Shapes are remembered constellations of sensory, linguistic, conceptual, episodic, and procedural knowledge that allow agents to cut through the complexity of real life the same way as people do: by expecting things to be typical, recognizing patterns, acting by habit, reasoning by analogy, satisficing, and generally minimizing cognitive load to the degree situations permit. Atypical outcomes are treated using shapes-based recovery methods, such as learning on the fly, asking a human partner for help, or seeking an actionable, even if imperfect, situational understanding. Although shapes is an umbrella term, it is not vague: shapes-based modeling involves particular objectives, hypotheses, modeling strategies, knowledge bases, and actual models of wide-ranging phenomena, all implemented within a particular cognitive architecture. Such specificity is needed both to vet our hypotheses and to achieve our practical aims of building useful agent systems that are explainable, extensible, and worthy of our trust, even in critical domains. However, although the LEIA example of shapes-based modeling is specific, the principles can be applied more broadly, giving new life to knowledge-based and hybrid AI.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13288v1
2509.13285v1,Contrastive timbre representations for musical instrument and synthesizer retrieval,Gwendal Le Vaillant; Yannick Molle,[Submitted on 16 Sep 2025],"Efficiently retrieving specific instrument timbres from audio mixtures remains a challenge in digital music production. This paper introduces a contrastive learning framework for musical instrument retrieval, enabling direct querying of instrument databases using a single model for both single- and multi-instrument sounds. We propose techniques to generate realistic positive/negative pairs of sounds for virtual musical instruments, such as samplers and synthesizers, addressing limitations in common audio data augmentation methods.The first experiment focuses on instrument retrieval from a dataset of 3,884 instruments, using single-instrument audio as input. Contrastive approaches are competitive with previous works based on classification pre-training. The second experiment considers multi-instrument retrieval with a mixture of instruments as audio input. In this case, the proposed contrastive framework outperforms related works, achieving 81.7\% top-1 and 95.7\% top-5 accuracies for three-instrument mixtures.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13285v1

While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made progress on chart question answering (CQA), the task remains challenging, particularly when models attend to irrelevant regions of the chart. In this work, we present ChartGaze, a new eye-tracking dataset that captures human gaze patterns during chart reasoning tasks. Through a systematic comparison of human and model attention, we find that LVLMs often diverge from human gaze, leading to reduced interpretability and accuracy. To address this, we propose a gaze-guided attention refinement that aligns image-text attention with human fixations. Our approach improves both answer accuracy and attention alignment, yielding gains of up to 2.56 percentage points across multiple models. These results demonstrate the promise of incorporating human gaze to enhance both the reasoning quality and interpretability of chart-focused LVLMs.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13282v1
2509.13281v1,RepIt: Representing Isolated Targets to Steer Language Models,Vincent Siu; Nathan W. Henry; Nicholas Crispino; Yang Liu; Dawn Song; Chenguang Wang,[Submitted on 16 Sep 2025],"While activation steering in large language models (LLMs) is a growing area of research, methods can often incur broader effects than desired. This motivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level. We present RepIt, a simple and data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific representations. Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks. By disentangling refusal vectors with RepIt, this work demonstrates that targeted interventions can counteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control of model behavior.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13281v1

Traditional radiology training is based on passive exposure to cases or active practice with real-time input from supervising radiologists, limiting opportunities for immediate and scalable feedback. RadGame addresses this gap by combining gamification with large-scale public datasets and automated, AI-driven feedback that provides clear, structured guidance to human learners. In RadGame Localize, players draw bounding boxes around abnormalities, which are automatically compared to radiologist-drawn annotations from public datasets, and visual explanations are generated by vision-language models for user missed findings. In RadGame Report, players compose findings given a chest X-ray, patient age and indication, and receive structured AI feedback based on radiology report generation metrics, highlighting errors and omissions compared to a radiologist's written ground truth report from public datasets, producing a final performance and style score. In a prospective evaluation, participants using RadGame achieved a 68% improvement in localization accuracy compared to 17% with traditional passive methods and a 31% improvement in report-writing accuracy compared to 4% with traditional methods after seeing the same cases. RadGame highlights the potential of AI-driven gamification to deliver scalable, feedback-rich radiology training and reimagines the application of medical AI resources in education.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13270v1
2509.12822v1,A Pressure-Based Diffusion Model for Influence Maximization on Social Networks,Curt Stutsman; Eliot W. Robson; Abhishek K. Umrawal,[Submitted on 16 Sep 2025],"In many real-world scenarios, an individual's local social network carries significant influence over the opinions they form and subsequently propagate to others. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model -- the Pressure Threshold model (PT) -- for dynamically simulating the spread of influence through a social network. This new model extends the popular Linear Threshold Model (LT) by adjusting a node's outgoing influence proportional to the influence it receives from its activated neighbors. We address the Influence Maximization (IM) problem, which involves selecting the most effective seed nodes to achieve maximal graph coverage after a diffusion process, and how the problem manifests with the PT Model. Experiments conducted on real-world networks, facilitated by enhancements to the open-source network-diffusion Python library, CyNetDiff, demonstrate unique seed node selection for the PT Model when compared to the LT Model. Moreover, analyses demonstrate that densely connected networks amplify pressure effects more significantly than sparse networks.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12822v1

Codella; Javier Alvarez-Valle; Korfiatis Panagiotis; Valentina Salvatelli,[Submitted on 16 Sep 2025],"Foundation vision encoders such as CLIP and DINOv2, trained on web-scale data, exhibit strong transfer performance across tasks and datasets. However, medical imaging foundation models remain constrained by smaller datasets, limiting our understanding of how data scale and pretraining paradigms affect performance in this setting. In this work, we systematically study continual pretraining of two vision encoders, MedImageInsight (MI2) and RAD-DINO representing the two major encoder paradigms CLIP and DINOv2, on up to 3.5M chest x-rays from a single institution, holding compute and evaluation protocols constant. We evaluate on classification (radiology findings, lines and tubes), segmentation (lines and tubes), and radiology report generation. While prior work has primarily focused on tasks related to radiology findings, we include lines and tubes tasks to counterbalance this bias and evaluate a model's ability to extract features that preserve continuity along elongated structures. Our experiments show that MI2 scales more effectively for finding-related tasks, while RAD-DINO is stronger on tube-related tasks. Surprisingly, continually pretraining MI2 with both reports and structured labels using UniCL improves performance, underscoring the value of structured supervision at scale. We further show that for some tasks, as few as 30k in-domain samples are sufficient to surpass open-weights foundation models. These results highlight the utility of center-specific continual pretraining, enabling medical institutions to derive significant performance gains by utilizing in-domain data.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12818v1

Virtual avatars increasingly use AI-generated gestures to enhance life-likeness, yet evaluations have largely been confined to 2D. Virtual Reality (VR) provides an immersive alternative that may affect how gestures are perceived.

2509.12814v1,Energy-Efficient Quantized Federated Learning for Resource-constrained IoT devices,Wilfrid Sougrinoma Compaoré; Yaya Etiabi; El Mehdi Amhoud; Mohamad Assaad,[Submitted on 16 Sep 2025],"Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling collaborative machine learning while preserving data privacy, making it particularly suitable for Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However, resource-constrained IoT devices face significant challenges due to limited energy,unreliable communication channels, and the impracticality of assuming infinite blocklength transmission. This paper proposes a federated learning framework for IoT networks that integrates finite blocklength transmission, model quantization, and an error-aware aggregation mechanism to enhance energy efficiency and communication reliability. The framework also optimizes uplink transmission power to balance energy savings and model performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces energy consumption by up to 75\% compared to a standard FL model, while maintaining robust model accuracy, making it a viable solution for FL in real-world IoT scenarios with constrained resources.

However, existing approaches often treat prior experiences and knowledge as monolithic units, leading to inefficient and coarse-grained knowledge transfer.

To construct and refine these hierarchical memories, we introduce Hierarchical Hindsight Reflection (H$^2$R), a mechanism that distills reusable and hierarchical knowledge from past agent-environment interactions. At test time, H$^2$R performs retrievals of high-level and low-level memories separately, allowing LLM-based agents to efficiently access and utilize task-relevant knowledge for newthis http URLresults across two benchmarks demonstrate that H$^2$R can improve generalization and decision-making performance, outperforming prior baselines such as Expel.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12810v1

In this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) when it comes to the automation of tasks and processes that aim to increase the flexibility of automotive systems. Three case studies towards achieving this goal are considered as outcomes of early-stage research: 1) updates, hardware abstraction, and compliance, 2) interface compatibility checking, and 3) architecture modification suggestions.

2509.12783v1,Fast reconstruction of degenerate populations of conductance-based neuron models from spike times,Julien Brandoit; Damien Ernst; Guillaume Drion; Arthur Fyon,[Submitted on 16 Sep 2025],"Neurons communicate through spikes, and spike timing is a crucial part of neuronal processing. Spike times can be recorded experimentally both intracellularly and extracellularly, and are the main output of state-of-the-art neural probes. On the other hand, neuronal activity is controlled at the molecular level by the currents generated by many different transmembrane proteins called ion channels. Connecting spike timing to ion channel composition remains an arduous task to date. To address this challenge, we developed a method that combines deep learning with a theoretical tool called Dynamic Input Conductances (DICs), which reduce the complexity of ion channel interactions into three interpretable components describing how neurons spike. Our approach uses deep learning to infer DICs directly from spike times and then generates populations of ""twin"" neuron models that replicate the observed activity while capturing natural variability in membrane channel composition. The method is fast, accurate, and works using only spike recordings. We also provide open-source software with a graphical interface, making it accessible to researchers without programming expertise.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12783v1
2509.12777v1,CECT-Mamba: a Hierarchical Contrast-enhanced-aware Model for Pancreatic Tumor Subtyping from Multi-phase CECT,Zhifang Gong; Shuo Gao; Ben Zhao; Yingjing Xu; Yijun Yang; Shenghong Ju; Guangquan Zhou,[Submitted on 16 Sep 2025],"Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is the primary imaging technique that provides valuable spatial-temporal information about lesions, enabling the accurate diagnosis and subclassification of pancreatic tumors. However, the high heterogeneity and variability of pancreatic tumors still pose substantial challenges for precise subtyping diagnosis. Previous methods fail to effectively explore the contextual information across multiple CECT phases commonly used in radiologists' diagnostic workflows, thereby limiting their performance. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, an automatic way to combine the multi-phase CECT data to discriminate between pancreatic tumor subtypes, among which the key is using Mamba with promising learnability and simplicity to encourage both temporal and spatial modeling from multi-phase CECT. Specifically, we propose a dual hierarchical contrast-enhanced-aware Mamba module incorporating two novel spatial and temporal sampling sequences to explore intra and inter-phase contrast variations of lesions. A similarity-guided refinement module is also imposed into the temporal scanning modeling to emphasize the learning on local tumor regions with more obvious temporal variations. Moreover, we design the space complementary integrator and multi-granularity fusion module to encode and aggregate the semantics across different scales, achieving more efficient learning for subtyping pancreatic tumors. The experimental results on an in-house dataset of 270 clinical cases achieve an accuracy of 97.4% and an AUC of 98.6% in distinguishing between pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs), demonstrating its potential as a more accurate and efficient tool.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12777v1

2509.12768v1,BATR-FST: Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for Few-Shot Transformers,Mohammed Al-Habib; Zuping Zhang; Abdulrahman Noman,[Submitted on 16 Sep 2025],"Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown significant promise in computer vision applications. However, their performance in few-shot learning is limited by challenges in refining token-level interactions, struggling with limited training data, and developing a strong inductive bias. Existing methods often depend on inflexible token matching or basic similarity measures, which limit the effective incorporation of global context and localized feature refinement. To address these challenges, we propose Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for Few-Shot Transformers (BATR-FST), a two-stage approach that progressively improves token representations and maintains a robust inductive bias for few-shot classification. During the pre-training phase, Masked Image Modeling (MIM) provides Vision Transformers (ViTs) with transferable patch-level representations by recreating masked image regions, providing a robust basis for subsequent adaptation. In the meta-fine-tuning phase, BATR-FST incorporates a Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement module that utilizes Token Clustering to capture localized interactions, Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting to prioritize dependable features, and a Bi-Level Attention mechanism to balance intra-cluster and inter-cluster relationships, thereby facilitating thorough token refinement. Furthermore, Graph Token Propagation ensures semantic consistency between support and query instances, while a Class Separation Penalty preserves different class borders, enhancing discriminative capability.

However, current RAG frameworks often struggle with identifying whether retrieved documents meaningfully contribute to answer generation. This shortcoming makes it difficult to filter out irrelevant or even misleading content, which notably impacts the final performance. In this paper, we propose Document Information Gain (DIG), a novel metric designed to quantify the contribution of retrieved documents to correct answer generation. DIG measures a document's value by computing the difference of LLM's generation confidence with and without the document augmented. Further, we introduce InfoGain-RAG, a framework that leverages DIG scores to train a specialized reranker, which prioritizes each retrieved document from exact distinguishing and accurate sorting perspectives. This approach can effectively filter out irrelevant documents and select the most valuable ones for better answer generation. Extensive experiments across various models and benchmarks demonstrate that InfoGain-RAG can significantly outperform existing approaches, on both single and multiple retrievers paradigm. Specifically on NaturalQA, it achieves the improvements of 17.9%, 4.5%, 12.5% in exact match accuracy against naive RAG, self-reflective RAG and modern ranking-based RAG respectively, and even an average of 15.3% increment on advanced proprietary model GPT-4o across all datasets.

2509.12760v1,Similarity-Distance-Magnitude Activations,Allen Schmaltz,[Submitted on 16 Sep 2025],"We introduce a more robust and interpretable formulation of the standard softmax activation function commonly used with neural networks by adding Similarity (i.e., correctly predicted depth-matches into training) awareness and Distance-to-training-distribution awareness to the existing output Magnitude (i.e., decision-boundary) awareness. When used as the final-layer activation with language models, the resulting Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) activation function is more robust than the softmax function to co-variate shifts and out-of-distribution inputs in high-probability regions, and provides interpretability-by-exemplar via dense matching. Complementing the prediction-conditional estimates, the SDM activation enables a partitioning of the class-wise empirical CDFs to guard against low class-wise recall among selective classifications. These properties make it preferable for selective classification, even when considering post-hoc calibration methods over the softmax.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12760v1

However, ownership cannot be reliably inferred from visual features alone. To address this gap, we propose Active Ownership Learning (ActOwL), a framework that enables robots to actively generate and ask ownership-related questions to users. ActOwL employs a probabilistic generative model to select questions that maximize information gain, thereby acquiring ownership knowledge efficiently to improve learning efficiency. Additionally, by leveraging commonsense knowledge from Large Language Models (LLM), objects are pre-classified as either shared or owned, and only owned objects are targeted for questioning. Through experiments in a simulated home environment and a real-world laboratory setting, ActOwL achieved significantly higher ownership clustering accuracy with fewer questions than baseline methods. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining active inference with LLM-guided commonsense reasoning, advancing the capability of robots to acquire ownership knowledge for practical and socially appropriate task execution.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12754v1

This approach circumvents the limitations of existing methods that require extensive finetuning or depend on predefined algorithms, and it incorporates an error feedback loop with a time-out mechanism to ensure both correctness and efficiency. Experimental evaluations on the GraphInstruct dataset reveal that GRRAF achieves 100% accuracy on most graph reasoning tasks, including cycle detection, bipartite graph checks, shortest path computation, and maximum flow, while maintaining consistent token costs regardless of graph sizes. Imperfect but still very high performance is observed on subgraph matching. Notably, GRRAF scales effectively to large graphs with up to 10,000 nodes.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12743v1

To ensure an effective and comfortable dressing experience, the robot must be able to handle challenging deformable garments, apply appropriate forces, and adapt to limb movements throughout the dressing process. Prior work often makes simplifying assumptions -- such as static human limbs during dressing -- which limits real-world applicability. In this work, we develop a robot-assisted dressing system capable of handling partial observations with visual occlusions, as well as robustly adapting to arm motions during the dressing process. Given a policy trained in simulation with partial observations, we propose a method to fine-tune it in the real world using a small amount of data and multi-modal feedback from vision and force sensing, to further improve the policy's adaptability to arm motions and enhance safety. We evaluate our method in simulation with simplified articulated human meshes and in a real world human study with 12 participants across 264 dressing trials. Our policy successfully dresses two long-sleeve everyday garments onto the participants while being adaptive to various kinds of arm motions, and greatly outperforms prior baselines in terms of task completion and user feedback.

2509.12740v1,Deep Generative and Discriminative Digital Twin endowed with Variational Autoencoder for Unsupervised Predictive Thermal Condition Monitoring of Physical Robots in Industry 6.0 and Society 6.0,Eric Guiffo Kaigom,[Submitted on 16 Sep 2025],"Robots are unrelentingly used to achieve operational efficiency in Industry 4.0 along with symbiotic and sustainable assistance for the work-force in Industry 5.0. As resilience, robustness, and well-being are required in anti-fragile manufacturing and human-centric societal tasks, an autonomous anticipation and adaption to thermal saturation and burns due to motors overheating become instrumental for human safety and robot availability. Robots are thereby expected to self-sustain their performance and deliver user experience, in addition to communicating their capability to other agents in advance to ensure fully automated thermally feasible tasks, and prolong their lifetime without human intervention. However, the traditional robot shutdown, when facing an imminent thermal saturation, inhibits productivity in factories and comfort in the society, while cooling strategies are hard to implement after the robot acquisition. In this work, smart digital twins endowed with generative AI, i.e., variational autoencoders, are leveraged to manage thermally anomalous and generate uncritical robot states. The notion of thermal difficulty is derived from the reconstruction error of variational autoencoders. A robot can use this score to predict, anticipate, and share the thermal feasibility of desired motion profiles to meet requirements from emerging applications in Industry 6.0 and Society 6.0.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12740v1

2509.12732v1,A Novel Recurrent Neural Network Framework for Prediction and Treatment of Oncogenic Mutation Progression,Rishab Parthasarathy; Achintya Bhowmik,[Submitted on 16 Sep 2025],"Despite significant medical advancements, cancer remains the second leading cause of death, with over 600,000 deaths per year in the US. One emerging field, pathway analysis, is promising but still relies on manually derived wet lab data, which is time-consuming to acquire. This work proposes an efficient, effective end-to-end framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pathway analysis that predicts both cancer severity and mutation progression, thus recommending possible treatments. The proposed technique involves a novel combination of time-series machine learning models and pathway analysis. First, mutation sequences were isolated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database. Then, a novel preprocessing algorithm was used to filter key mutations by mutation frequency. This data was fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that predicted cancer severity. Then, the model probabilistically used the RNN predictions, information from the preprocessing algorithm, and multiple drug-target databases to predict future mutations and recommend possible treatments. This framework achieved robust results and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves (a key statistical metric) with accuracies greater than 60%, similar to existing cancer diagnostics. In addition, preprocessing played an instrumental role in isolating important mutations, demonstrating that each cancer stage studied may contain on the order of a few-hundred key driver mutations, consistent with current research. Heatmaps based on predicted gene frequency were also generated, highlighting key mutations in each cancer. Overall, this work is the first to propose an efficient, cost-effective end-to-end framework for projecting cancer progression and providing possible treatments without relying on expensive, time-consuming wet lab work.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12732v1
2509.12730v1,A Graph Machine Learning Approach for Detecting Topological Patterns in Transactional Graphs,Francesco Zola; Jon Ander Medina; Andrea Venturi; Amaia Gil; Raul Orduna,[Submitted on 16 Sep 2025],"The rise of digital ecosystems has exposed the financial sector to evolving abuse and criminal tactics that share operational knowledge and techniques both within and across different environments (fiat-based, crypto-assets, etc.). Traditional rule-based systems lack the adaptability needed to detect sophisticated or coordinated criminal behaviors (patterns), highlighting the need for strategies that analyze actors' interactions to uncover suspicious activities and extract their modus operandi. For this reason, in this work, we propose an approach that integrates graph machine learning and network analysis to improve the detection of well-known topological patterns within transactional graphs. However, a key challenge lies in the limitations of traditional financial datasets, which often provide sparse, unlabeled information that is difficult to use for graph-based pattern analysis. Therefore, we firstly propose a four-step preprocessing framework that involves (i) extracting graph structures, (ii) considering data temporality to manage large node sets, (iii) detecting communities within, and (iv) applying automatic labeling strategies to generate weak ground-truth labels. Then, once the data is processed, Graph Autoencoders are implemented to distinguish among the well-known topological patterns. Specifically, three different GAE variants are implemented and compared in this analysis. Preliminary results show that this pattern-focused, topology-driven method is effective for detecting complex financial crime schemes, offering a promising alternative to conventional rule-based detection systems.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12730v1

We present a novel off-the-shelf solution that leverages a diffusion model trained solely on object amplitude to recover both amplitude and phase from diffraction intensities. Using a predictor-corrector sampling framework with separate likelihood gradients for amplitude and phase, our method enables complex field reconstruction without requiring ground-truth phase data for training. We validate the proposed approach through extensive simulations and experiments, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse object shapes, imaging system configurations, and modalities, including lensless setups. Notably, a diffusion prior trained on simple amplitude data (e.g., polystyrene beads) successfully reconstructs complex biological tissue structures, highlighting the method's adaptability. This framework provides a cost-effective, generalizable solution for nonlinear inverse problems in computational imaging, and establishes a foundation for broader coherent imaging applications beyond holography.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12728v1
2509.12727v1,Unbiased Online Curvature Approximation for Regularized Graph Continual Learning,Jie Yin; Ke Sun; Han Wu,[Submitted on 16 Sep 2025],"Graph continual learning (GCL) aims to learn from a continuous sequence of graph-based tasks. Regularization methods are vital for preventing catastrophic forgetting in GCL, particularly in the challenging replay-free, class-incremental setting, where each task consists of a set of unique classes. In this work, we first establish a general regularization framework for GCL based on the curved parameter space induced by the Fisher information matrix (FIM). We show that the dominant Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and its variants are a special case within this framework, using a diagonal approximation of the empirical FIM based on parameters from previous tasks. To overcome their limitations, we propose a new unbiased online curvature approximation of the full FIM based on the model's current learning state. Our method directly estimates the regularization term in an online manner without explicitly evaluating and storing the FIM itself. This enables the model to better capture the loss landscape during learning new tasks while retaining the knowledge learned from previous tasks. Extensive experiments on three graph datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing regularization-based methods, achieving a superior trade-off between stability (retaining old knowledge) and plasticity (acquiring new knowledge).",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12727v1
2509.12724v1,Defense-to-Attack: Bypassing Weak Defenses Enables Stronger Jailbreaks in Vision-Language Models,Yunhan Zhao; Xiang Zheng; Xingjun Ma,[Submitted on 16 Sep 2025],"Despite their superb capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been shown to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. While recent jailbreaks have achieved notable progress, their effectiveness and efficiency can still be improved. In this work, we reveal an interesting phenomenon: incorporating weak defense into the attack pipeline can significantly enhance both the effectiveness and the efficiency of jailbreaks on VLMs. Building on this insight, we propose Defense2Attack, a novel jailbreak method that bypasses the safety guardrails of VLMs by leveraging defensive patterns to guide jailbreak prompt design. Specifically, Defense2Attack consists of three key components: (1) a visual optimizer that embeds universal adversarial perturbations with affirmative and encouraging semantics; (2) a textual optimizer that refines the input using a defense-styled prompt; and (3) a red-team suffix generator that enhances the jailbreak through reinforcement fine-tuning. We empirically evaluate our method on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks. The results demonstrate that Defense2Attack achieves superior jailbreak performance in a single attempt, outperforming state-of-the-art attack methods that often require multiple tries. Our work offers a new perspective on jailbreaking VLMs.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12724v1

Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations offer promising solutions with their global coverage capabilities and reduced latency, yet struggle with intermittent coverage and limited communication windows due to orbital dynamics. This paper introduces an age of information (AoI)-aware space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) architecture that leverages a high-altitude platform (HAP) as intelligent relay between the LEO satellites and ground terminals. Our three-layer design employs hybrid free-space optical (FSO) links for high-capacity satellite-to-HAP communication and reliable radio frequency (RF) links for HAP-to-ground transmission, and thus addressing the temporal discontinuity in LEO satellite coverage while serving diverse user priorities. Specifically, we formulate a joint optimization problem to simultaneously minimize the AoI and satellite handover frequency through optimal transmit power distribution and satellite selection decisions. This highly dynamic, non-convex problem with time-coupled constraints presents significant computational challenges for traditional approaches. To address these difficulties, we propose a novel diffusion model (DM)-enhanced dueling double deep Q-network with action decomposition and state transformer encoder (DD3QN-AS) algorithm that incorporates transformer-based temporal feature extraction and employs a DM-based latent prompt generative module to refine state-action representations through conditional denoising.

In this work, we investigate the predictive potential of routinely collected non-renal clinical variables for CKD classification, including sociodemographic factors, comorbid conditions, and urinalysis findings. We introduce the Nephrology-Oriented Representation leArning (NORA) approach, which combines supervised contrastive learning with a nonlinear Random Forest classifier. NORA first derives discriminative patient representations from tabular EHR data, which are then used for downstream CKD classification. We evaluated NORA on a clinic-based EHR dataset from Riverside Nephrology Physicians.

It is still a challenge to fine-tune foundation models for a small group of new users or specialized scenarios, which typically involve limited data compared to the large-scale data used in pre-training. In this context, the trade-off between personalization and federation becomes more sensitive. To tackle these, we proposed a bi-level personalization framework for federated fine-tuning on foundation models. Specifically, we conduct personalized fine-tuning on the client-level using its private data, and then conduct a personalized aggregation on the server-level using similar users measured by client-specific task vectors. Given the personalization information gained from client-level fine-tuning, the server-level personalized aggregation can gain group-wise personalization information while mitigating the disturbance of irrelevant or interest-conflict clients with non-IID data. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been demonstrated by extensive experimental analysis in benchmark datasets.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12697v1
2509.12694v1,Soft Graph Transformer for MIMO Detection,Jiadong Hong; Lei Liu; Xinyu Bian; Wenjie Wang; Zhaoyang Zhang,[Submitted on 16 Sep 2025],"We propose the Soft Graph Transformer (SGT), a Soft-Input-Soft-Output neural architecture tailored for MIMO detection. While Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection achieves optimal accuracy, its prohibitive exponential complexity renders it impractical for real-world systems. Conventional message passing algorithms offer tractable alternatives but rely on large-system asymptotics and random matrix assumptions, both of which break down under practical implementations. Prior Transformer-based detectors, on the other hand, fail to incorporate the MIMO factor graph structure and cannot utilize decoder-side soft information, limiting their standalone performance and their applicability in iterative detection-decoding (IDD). To overcome these limitations, SGT integrates message passing directly into a graph-aware attention mechanism and supports decoder-informed updates through soft-input embeddings. This design enables effective soft-output generation while preserving computational efficiency. As a standalone detector, SGT closely approaches ML performance and surpasses prior Transformer-based approaches.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12694v1
2509.12688v1,ZTree: A Subgroup Identification Based Decision Tree Learning Framework,Eric Cheng; Jie Cheng,[Submitted on 16 Sep 2025],"Decision trees are a commonly used class of machine learning models valued for their interpretability and versatility, capable of both classification and regression. We propose ZTree, a novel decision tree learning framework that replaces CART's traditional purity based splitting with statistically principled subgroup identification. At each node, ZTree applies hypothesis testing (e.g., z-tests, t-tests, Mann-Whitney U, log-rank) to assess whether a candidate subgroup differs meaningfully from the complement. To adjust for the complication of multiple testing, we employ a cross-validation-based approach to determine if further node splitting is needed. This robust stopping criterion eliminates the need for post-pruning and makes the test threshold (z-threshold) the only parameter for controlling tree complexity. Because of the simplicity of the tree growing procedure, once a detailed tree is learned using the most lenient z-threshold, all simpler trees can be derived by simply removing nodes that do not meet the larger z-thresholds. This makes parameter tuning intuitive and efficient. Furthermore, this z-threshold is essentially a p-value, allowing users to easily plug in appropriate statistical tests into our framework without adjusting the range of parameter search. Empirical evaluation on five large-scale UCI datasets demonstrates that ZTree consistently delivers strong performance, especially at low data regimes. Compared to CART, ZTree also tends to grow simpler trees without sacrificing performance. ZTree introduces a statistically grounded alternative to traditional decision tree splitting by leveraging hypothesis testing and a cross-validation approach to multiple testing correction, resulting in an efficient and flexible framework.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12688v1
2509.12682v1,A Comparative Study of YOLOv8 to YOLOv11 Performance in Underwater Vision Tasks,Gordon Hung; Ivan Felipe Rodriguez,[Submitted on 16 Sep 2025],"Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) increasingly rely on on-board computer-vision systems for tasks such as habitat mapping, ecological monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. However, underwater imagery is hindered by light attenuation, turbidity, and severe class imbalance, while the computational resources available on AUVs are limited. One-stage detectors from the YOLO family are attractive because they fuse localization and classification in a single, low-latency network; however, their terrestrial benchmarks (COCO, PASCAL-VOC, Open Images) leave open the question of how successive YOLO releases perform in the marine domain. We curate two openly available datasets that span contrasting operating conditions: a Coral Disease set (4,480 images, 18 classes) and a Fish Species set (7,500 images, 20 classes). For each dataset, we create four training regimes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %, 100 % of the images) while keeping balanced validation and test partitions fixed. We train YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, and YOLOv11-s with identical hyperparameters (100 epochs, 640 px input, batch = 16, T4 GPU) and evaluate precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, per-image inference time, and frames-per-second (FPS). Post-hoc Grad-CAM visualizations probe feature utilization and localization faithfulness. Across both datasets, accuracy saturates after YOLOv9, suggesting architectural innovations primarily target efficiency rather than accuracy. Inference speed, however, improves markedly. Our results (i) provide the first controlled comparison of recent YOLO variants on underwater imagery, (ii) show that lightweight YOLOv10 offers the best speed-accuracy trade-off for embedded AUV deployment, and (iii) deliver an open, reproducible benchmark and codebase to accelerate future marine-vision research.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12682v1

Motivated by the fact that neural quantum states (NQS) has increasingly adopted LLM-based components, we seek to understand NQS scaling laws, thereby shedding light on the scalability and optimal performance--resource trade-offs of NQS ansatze. In particular, we identify scaling laws that predict the performance, as measured by absolute error and V-score, for transformer-based NQS as a function of problem size in second-quantized quantum chemistry applications. By performing analogous compute-constrained optimization of the obtained parametric curves, we find that the relationship between model size and training time is highly dependent on loss metric and ansatz, and does not follow the approximately linear relationship found for language models.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12679v1

Moreover, different LLMs can have different preferences for a certain setting of random factors. As a result, using a fixed setting of random factors, which is often adopted as the paradigm of current evaluations, can lead to potential unfair comparisons between LLMs. To mitigate the volatility of evaluations, we first theoretically analyze the sources of variance induced by changes in random factors. Targeting these specific sources, we then propose the instance-level randomization (ILR) method to reduce variance and enhance fairness in model comparisons. Instead of using a fixed setting across the whole benchmark in a single experiment, we randomize all factors that affect evaluation scores for every single instance, run multiple experiments and report the averaged score. Theoretical analyses and empirical results demonstrate that ILR can reduce the variance and unfair comparisons caused by random factors, as well as achieve similar robustness level with less than half computational cost compared with previous methods.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12678v1

This task is challenging due to the significant appearance variations of objects observed from variable views, along with the difficulty in extracting discriminative features. Existing approaches often rely on extracting features through feature map segmentation while neglecting spatial and semantic information. To address these issues, we propose the EVA02-based Multi-scale Frequency Attention Fusion (MFAF) method. The MFAF method consists of Multi-Frequency Branch-wise Block (MFB) and the Frequency-aware Spatial Attention (FSA) module. The MFB block effectively captures both low-frequency structural features and high-frequency edge details across multiple scales, improving the consistency and robustness of feature representations across various viewpoints. Meanwhile, the FSA module adaptively focuses on the key regions of frequency features, significantly mitigating the interference caused by background noise and viewpoint variability.

Also, the t-conorms were suggested as addition rules by Sugeno for so-called alpha-fuzzy measures. The resolution of the feasible region of the problem is firstly investigated when it is defined with max-Sugeno-Weber composition and a necessary and sufficient condition is presented for determining the feasibility.

Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling advances beyond classical compartmental approaches by using a mechanistic, physiology focused framework. A PBPK model is based on a system of ODEs, with each equation representing the mass balance of a drug in a compartment, such as an organ or tissue. These ODEs include parameters that reflect physiological, biochemical, and drug-specific characteristics to simulate how the drug moves through the body. In this paper, we introduce PBPK-iPINN, a method to estimate drug-specific or patient-specific parameters and drug concentration profiles in PBPK brain compartment models using inverse PINNs. We demonstrate that, for the inverse problem to converge to the correct solution, the loss function components (data loss, initial conditions loss, and residual loss) must be appropriately weighted, and parameters (including number of layers, number of neurons, activation functions, learning rate, optimizer, and collocation points) must be carefully tuned.

Instead of explicit channel state information (CSI) estimation, the framework exploits uplink pilot sequences to implicitly learn channel characteristics, reducing both pilot overhead and inference complexity. Practical hardware constraints are addressed by incorporating the phase-dependent amplitude model of RIS elements, while a multi-label training strategy improves robustness when multiple near-optimal codewords yield comparable performance. Simulations show that the proposed design achieves over 90% of the spectral efficiency of exhaustive search (ES) with only 2.2% of its computation time, cutting energy consumption by nearly two orders of magnitude. The method also demonstrates resilience under distribution mismatch and scalability to larger RIS arrays, making it a practical and energy-efficient solution for sustainable 6G wireless networks.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12658v1

While existing benchmarks demonstrate technical progress, they suffer from misalignment artifacts that poorly reflect real-world manipulation patterns: practical attacks typically maintain semantic consistency across modalities, whereas current datasets artificially disrupt cross-modal alignment, creating easily detectable anomalies. To bridge this gap, we pioneer the detection of semantically-coordinated manipulations where visual edits are systematically paired with semantically consistent textual descriptions. Our approach begins with constructing the first Semantic-Aligned Multimodal Manipulation (SAMM) dataset, generated through a two-stage pipeline: 1) applying state-of-the-art image manipulations, followed by 2) generation of contextually-plausible textual narratives that reinforce the visual deception. Building on this foundation, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Manipulation Detection and Grounding (RamDG) framework. RamDG commences by harnessing external knowledge repositories to retrieve contextual evidence, which serves as the auxiliary texts and encoded together with the inputs through our image forgery grounding and deep manipulation detection modules to trace all manipulations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 2.06\% higher detection accuracy on SAMM compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

If the behavior of LLMs can be intentionally steered toward specific ideological positions, such as political or religious views, then those who control these systems could gain disproportionate influence over public discourse. Although it remains an open question whether LLMs can reliably be guided toward coherent ideological stances and whether such steering can be effectively prevented, a crucial first step is to develop methods for detecting when such steering attempts occur. In this work, we adapt a previously proposed statistical method to the new context of ideological bias auditing. Our approach carries over the model-agnostic design of the original framework, which does not require access to the internals of the language model. Instead, it identifies potential ideological steering by analyzing distributional shifts in model outputs across prompts that are thematically related to a chosen topic. This design makes the method particularly suitable for auditing proprietary black-box systems. We validate our approach through a series of experiments, demonstrating its practical applicability and its potential to support independent post hoc audits of LLM behavior.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12652v1
2509.12650v1,Leveraging Intermediate Representations of Time Series Foundation Models for Anomaly Detection,Chan Sik Han; Keon Myung Lee,[Submitted on 16 Sep 2025],"Detecting anomalies in time series data is essential for the reliable operation of many real-world systems. Recently, time series foundation models (TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for anomaly detection. However, existing methods typically rely on the final layer's representations of TSFMs, computing the anomaly score as a reconstruction or forecasting error via a task-specific head. Instead, we propose TimeRep, a novel anomaly detection approach that leverages the intermediate layer's representations of TSFMs, computing the anomaly score as the distance between these representations. Given a pre-trained TSFM, TimeRep selects the intermediate layer and patch-token position that yield the most informative representation. TimeRep forms a reference collection of intermediate representations from the training data and applies a core-set strategy to reduce its size while maintaining distributional coverage. During inference, TimeRep computes the anomaly score for incoming data by measuring the distance between its intermediate representations and those of the collection. To address concept drift, TimeRep integrates an adaptation mechanism that, at inference time, augments the collection exclusively with non-redundant intermediate representations from incoming data. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive, which contains 250 univariate time series. TimeRep consistently outperforms a broad spectrum of state-of-the-art baselines, including non-DL, DL, and foundation model-based methods.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12650v1

Though existing ARD approaches enhance student model's robustness, the inevitable by-product leads to the degraded performance on clean examples. We summarize the causes of this problem inherent in existing methods with dual-teacher framework as: 1. The divergent optimization objectives of dual-teacher models, i.e., the clean and robust teachers, impede effective knowledge transfer to the student model, and 2. The iteratively generated adversarial examples during training lead to performance deterioration of the robust teacher model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Cyclic Iterative ARD (CIARD) method with two key innovations: a. A multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment to resolve conflicts in dual-teacher optimization objectives, and b. Continuous adversarial retraining to maintain dynamic teacher robustness against performance degradation from the varying adversarial examples. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that CIARD achieves remarkable performance with an average 3.53 improvement in adversarial defense rates across various attack scenarios and a 5.87 increase in clean sample accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for balancing model robustness and generalization.

2509.12630v1,High-Energy Concentration for Federated Learning in Frequency Domain,Haozhi Shi; Weiying Xie; Hangyu Ye; Daixun Li; Jitao Ma; Leyuan Fang,[Submitted on 16 Sep 2025],"Federated Learning (FL) presents significant potential for collaborative optimization without data sharing. Since synthetic data is sent to the server, leveraging the popular concept of dataset distillation, this FL framework protects real data privacy while alleviating data heterogeneity. However, such methods are still challenged by the redundant information and noise in entire spatial-domain designs, which inevitably increases the communication burden. In this paper, we propose a novel Frequency-Domain aware FL method with high-energy concentration (FedFD) to address this problem. Our FedFD is inspired by the discovery that the discrete cosine transform predominantly distributes energy to specific regions, referred to as high-energy concentration. The principle behind FedFD is that low-energy like high-frequency components usually contain redundant information and noise, thus filtering them helps reduce communication costs and optimize performance. Our FedFD is mathematically formulated to preserve the low-frequency components using a binary mask, facilitating an optimal solution through frequency-domain distribution alignment. In particular, real data-driven synthetic classification is imposed into the loss to enhance the quality of the low-frequency components. On five image and speech datasets, FedFD achieves superior performance than state-of-the-art methods while reducing communication costs. For example, on the CIFAR-10 dataset with Dirichlet coefficient $\alpha = 0.01$, FedFD achieves a minimum reduction of 37.78\% in the communication cost, while attaining a 10.88\% performance gain.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12630v1

Current methods suffer from model-specific ECG encoders, hindering transfer across LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs struggle to capture crucial time-scale information inherent in ECGs due to Transformer limitations. And their black-box nature limits clinical adoption. To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-aBcDe, a novel ECG encoding method that transforms ECG signals into a universal ECG language readily interpretable by any LLM. By constructing a hybrid dataset of ECG language and natural language, ECG-aBcDe enables direct fine-tuning of pre-trained LLMs without architectural modifications, achieving ""construct once, use anywhere"" capability. Moreover, the bidirectional convertibility between ECG and ECG language of ECG-aBcDe allows for extracting attention heatmaps from ECG signals, significantly enhancing interpretability. Finally, ECG-aBcDe explicitly represents time-scale information, mitigating Transformer limitations. This work presents a new paradigm for integrating ECG analysis with LLMs. Compared with existing methods, our method achieves competitive performance on ROUGE-L and METEOR. Notably, it delivers significant improvements in the BLEU-4, with improvements of 2.8 times and 3.9 times in in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, respectively, reaching scores of 42.58 and 30.76.

Existing MLLM-based VLN methods primarily rely on imitation learning (IL) and often use DAgger for post-training to mitigate covariate shift. While effective, these approaches incur substantial data collection and training costs. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. However, prior VLN RL methods lack dynamic interaction with the environment and depend on expert trajectories for reward shaping, rather than engaging in open-ended active exploration. This restricts the agent's ability to discover diverse and plausible navigation routes. To address these limitations, we propose ActiveVLN, a VLN framework that explicitly enables active exploration through multi-turn RL. In the first stage, a small fraction of expert trajectories is used for IL to bootstrap the agent. In the second stage, the agent iteratively predicts and executes actions, automatically collects diverse trajectories, and optimizes multiple rollouts via the GRPO objective. To further improve RL efficiency, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping strategy to prune long-tail or likely failed trajectories, along with additional engineering optimizations. Experiments show that ActiveVLN achieves the largest performance gains over IL baselines compared to both DAgger-based and prior RL-based post-training methods, while reaching competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches despite using a smaller model.

In this paper, a novel technique termed MB CWG is proposed to forecast the one month advanced weight gain of herd based cattle using historical data collected from the Charles Sturt University Farm. This research employs a Random Forest (RF) model, comparing its performance against Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models for monthly weight gain prediction. Four datasets were used to evaluate the performance of models, using 756 sample data from 108 herd-based cattle, along with weather data (rainfall and temperature) influencing CWG. The RF model performs better than the SVR and LSTM models across all datasets, achieving an R^2 of 0.973, RMSE of 0.040, and MAE of 0.033 when both weather and age factors were included. The results indicate that including both weather and age factors significantly improves the accuracy of weight gain predictions, with the RF model outperforming the SVR and LSTM models in all scenarios. These findings demonstrate the potential of RF as a robust tool for forecasting cattle weight gain in variable conditions, highlighting the influence of age and climatic factors on herd based weight trends. This study has also developed an innovative automated pre processing tool to generate a benchmark dataset for MB CWG predictive models.

With the rise of AI techniques such as Large Language Models (LLMs), which demonstrate strong text understanding capabilities, there has been renewed interest in enhancing these systems. Existing methods, however, often struggle to capture the complex economic context of news and lack transparent reasoning, which undermines their reliability. We propose Analogy-Driven Financial Chain-of-Thought (AD-FCoT), a prompting framework that integrates analogical reasoning with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for sentiment prediction on historical financial news. AD-FCoT guides LLMs to draw parallels between new events and relevant historical scenarios with known outcomes, embedding these analogies into a structured, step-by-step reasoning chain. To our knowledge, this is among the first approaches to explicitly combine analogical examples with CoT reasoning in finance. Operating purely through prompting, AD-FCoT requires no additional training data or fine-tuning and leverages the model's internal financial knowledge to generate rationales that mirror human analytical reasoning. Experiments on thousands of news articles show that AD-FCoT outperforms strong baselines in sentiment classification accuracy and achieves substantially higher correlation with market returns. Its generated explanations also align with domain expertise, providing interpretable insights suitable for real-world financial analysis.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12611v1

However, modern workloads increasingly involve unstructured documents, which demands semantic understanding, beyond traditional value-based predicates. Given enormous documents and ad-hoc queries, while Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate powerful zero-shot capabilities, their high inference cost leads to unacceptable overhead. Therefore, we introduce \textsc{ScaleDoc}, a novel system that addresses this by decoupling predicate execution into an offline representation phase and an optimized online filtering phase. In the offline phase, \textsc{ScaleDoc} leverages a LLM to generate semantic representations for each document. Online, for each query, it trains a lightweight proxy model on these representations to filter the majority of documents, forwarding only the ambiguous cases to the LLM for final decision. Furthermore, \textsc{ScaleDoc} proposes two core innovations to achieve significant efficiency: (1) a contrastive-learning-based framework that trains the proxy model to generate reliable predicating decision scores; (2) an adaptive cascade mechanism that determines the effective filtering policy while meeting specific accuracy targets. Our evaluations across three datasets demonstrate that \textsc{ScaleDoc} achieves over a 2$\times$ end-to-end speedup and reduces expensive LLM invocations by up to 85\%, making large-scale semantic analysis practical and efficient.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12610v1

In this paper, we systematically compare the efficiency of different test-time scaling strategies for ATP models and demonstrate the inefficiency of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source approaches. We then investigate approaches to significantly reduce token usage and sample passes while maintaining the original performance. Specifically, we propose two complementary methods that can be integrated into a unified EconRL pipeline for amplified benefits: (1) a dynamic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) switching mechanism designed to mitigate unnecessary token consumption, and (2) Diverse parallel-scaled reinforcement learning (RL) with trainable prefixes to enhance pass rates under constrained sampling passes.

Even this poses a serious security challenge for the localization of self-driving cars, there has been very little exploration of attack on it, as most of adversarial attacks have been applied to 3D perception. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack framework called DisorientLiDAR targeting LiDAR-based localization. By reverse-engineering localization models (e.g., feature extraction networks), adversaries can identify critical keypoints and strategically remove them, thereby disrupting LiDAR-based localization. Our proposal is first evaluated on three state-of-the-art point-cloud registration models (HRegNet, D3Feat, and GeoTransformer) using the KITTI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that removing regions containing Top-K keypoints significantly degrades their registration accuracy. We further validate the attack's impact on the Autoware autonomous driving platform, where hiding merely a few critical regions induces noticeable localization drift. Finally, we extended our attacks to the physical world by hiding critical regions with near-infrared absorptive materials, thereby successfully replicate the attack effects observed in KITTI data.

Although existing methods have achieved remarkable results, the selection of target timesteps during distillation mainly relies on deterministic or stochastic strategies, which often require sampling schedulers to be designed specifically for different distillation processes. Moreover, this pattern severely limits flexibility, thereby restricting the full sampling potential of diffusion models in practical applications. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive sampling scheduler that is applicable to various consistency distillation frameworks. The scheduler introduces three innovative strategies: (i) dynamic target timestep selection, which adapts to different consistency distillation frameworks by selecting timesteps based on their computed importance; (ii) Optimized alternating sampling along the solution trajectory by guiding forward denoising and backward noise addition based on the proposed time step importance, enabling more effective exploration of the solution space to enhance generation performance; and (iii) Utilization of smoothing clipping and color balancing techniques to achieve stable and high-quality generation results at high guidance scales, thereby expanding the applicability of consistency distillation models in complex generation scenarios. We validated the effectiveness and flexibility of the adaptive sampling scheduler across various consistency distillation methods through comprehensive experimental evaluations.

Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of iCD across diverse teacher-student architectures, with particularly strong performance in fine-grained classification tasks -- achieving a peak improvement of +5.08% over the baseline.

A cross-modal deep metric learning feature clustering model is constructed, composed of an input layer, a triplet selection layer, and a loss function computation layer. The squared Euclidean distances between cluster centers are calculated, and a stochastic gradient descent strategy is employed to optimize the model and classify different time series features. The inner product of principal component direction vectors is used as a metric for anomaly measurement. The von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution is applied to describe the directional characteristics of time series data, and historical data is used to train and obtain evaluation parameters. By comparing the principal component direction vector of actual time series data with the threshold, anomaly detection is performed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately classifies time series data with different attributes, exhibits high sensitivity to anomalies, and achieves high detection accuracy, fast detection speed, and strong robustness.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12540v1
2509.12539v1,LEAF: Knowledge Distillation of Text Embedding Models with Teacher-Aligned Representations,Robin Vujanic; Thomas Rueckstiess,[Submitted on 16 Sep 2025],"We present LEAF (""Lightweight Embedding Alignment Framework""), a knowledge distillation framework for text embedding models. A key distinguishing feature is that our distilled leaf models are aligned to their teacher. In the context of information retrieval, this allows for flexible asymmetric architectures where documents are encoded with the larger teacher model, while queries can be served with the smaller leaf models. We also show that leaf models automatically inherit MRL and robustness to output quantization whenever these properties are present in the teacher model, without explicitly training for them. To demonstrate the capability of our framework we publish leaf-ir, a 23M parameters information retrieval oriented text embedding model trained using LEAF, which sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on BEIR, ranking #1 on the public leaderboard for this benchmark and for models of its size. When run in asymmetric mode, its retrieval performance is further increased. Our scheme is however not restricted to the information retrieval setting, and we demonstrate its wider applicability by synthesizing the multi-task leaf-mt model. This also sets a new SOTA, ranking #1 on the public MTEB v2 (English) leaderboard for its size. LEAF is applicable to black-box models and in contrast to other embedding model training frameworks, it does not require judgments nor hard negatives, and training can be conducted using small batch sizes. Thus, dataset and training infrastructure requirements for our framework are modest. We make our models publicly available under a permissive Apache 2.0 license.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12539v1
2509.12534v1,DeepEyeNet: Generating Medical Report for Retinal Images,Jia-Hong Huang,[Submitted on 16 Sep 2025],"The increasing prevalence of retinal diseases poses a significant challenge to the healthcare system, as the demand for ophthalmologists surpasses the available workforce. This imbalance creates a bottleneck in diagnosis and treatment, potentially delaying critical care. Traditional methods of generating medical reports from retinal images rely on manual interpretation, which is time-consuming and prone to errors, further straining ophthalmologists' limited resources. This thesis investigates the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate medical report generation for retinal images. AI can quickly analyze large volumes of image data, identifying subtle patterns essential for accurate diagnosis. By automating this process, AI systems can greatly enhance the efficiency of retinal disease diagnosis, reducing doctors' workloads and enabling them to focus on more complex cases. The proposed AI-based methods address key challenges in automated report generation: (1) A multi-modal deep learning approach captures interactions between textual keywords and retinal images, resulting in more comprehensive medical reports; (2) Improved methods for medical keyword representation enhance the system's ability to capture nuances in medical terminology; (3) Strategies to overcome RNN-based models' limitations, particularly in capturing long-range dependencies within medical descriptions; (4) Techniques to enhance the interpretability of the AI-based report generation system, fostering trust and acceptance in clinical practice. These methods are rigorously evaluated using various metrics and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This thesis demonstrates AI's potential to revolutionize retinal disease diagnosis by automating medical report generation, ultimately improving clinical efficiency, diagnostic accuracy, and patient care.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12534v1

Pattinson,[Submitted on 16 Sep 2025],"In visuomotor policy learning, the control policy for the robotic agent is derived directly from visual inputs. The typical approach, where a policy and vision encoder are trained jointly from scratch, generalizes poorly to novel visual scene changes. Using pre-trained vision models (PVMs) to inform a policy network improves robustness in model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). Recent developments in Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) suggest that MBRL is more sample-efficient than MFRL. However, counterintuitively, existing work has found PVMs to be ineffective in MBRL. Here, we investigate PVM's effectiveness in MBRL, specifically on generalization under visual domain shifts. We show that, in scenarios with severe shifts, PVMs perform much better than a baseline model trained from scratch. We further investigate the effects of varying levels of fine-tuning of PVMs. Our results show that partial fine-tuning can maintain the highest average task performance under the most extreme distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that PVMs are highly successful in promoting robustness in visual policy learning, providing compelling evidence for their wider adoption in model-based robotic learning applications.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12531v1
2509.12530v1,Graph Homophily Booster: Rethinking the Role of Discrete Features on Heterophilic Graphs,Ruizhong Qiu; Ting-Wei Li; Gaotang Li; Hanghang Tong,[Submitted on 16 Sep 2025],"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily. Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic graphs.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12530v1

However, their widespread adoption has also raised serious safety concerns. In this paper, we uncover a new safety risk of MLLMs: the output preference of MLLMs can be arbitrarily manipulated by carefully optimized images. Such attacks often generate contextually relevant yet biased responses that are neither overtly harmful nor unethical, making them difficult to detect. Specifically, we introduce a novel method, Preference Hijacking (Phi), for manipulating the MLLM response preferences using a preference hijacked image. Our method works at inference time and requires no model modifications. Additionally, we introduce a universal hijacking perturbation -- a transferable component that can be embedded into different images to hijack MLLM responses toward any attacker-specified preferences. Experimental results across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The code for Phi is accessible atthis https URL.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12521v1

The first pipeline trains a simple transformer to translate sentences from French into Bambara. The second fine-tunes LLaMA3 (3B-8B) instructor models using decoder-only architectures for French-to-Bambara translation. Models from the first two pipelines were trained with different hyperparameter combinations to improve BLEU and chrF scores, evaluated on both test sentences and official Bambara benchmarks. The third pipeline uses language distillation with a student-teacher dual neural network to integrate Bambara into a pre-trained LaBSE model, which provides language-agnostic embeddings. A BERT extension is then applied to LaBSE to generate translations. All pipelines were tested on Dokotoro (medical) and Bayelemagaba (mixed domains). Results show that the first pipeline, although simpler, achieves the best translation accuracy (10% BLEU, 21% chrF on Bayelemagaba), consistent with low-resource translation results. On the Yiri dataset, created for this work, it achieves 33.81% BLEU and 41% chrF.

Emerging vision foundation models such as DINOv2, pretrained on extensive, unlabeled datasets, offer generalized representations that can potentially alleviate these limitations. In this study, we propose an attention-based global aggregation framework tailored specifically for 3D medical image anomaly classification. Leveraging the self-supervised DINOv2 model as a pretrained feature extractor, our method processes individual 2D axial slices of brain MRIs, assigning adaptive slice-level importance weights through a soft attention mechanism. To further address data scarcity, we employ a composite loss function combining supervised contrastive learning with class-variance regularization, enhancing inter-class separability and intra-class consistency. We validate our framework on the ADNI dataset and an institutional multi-class headache cohort, demonstrating strong anomaly classification performance despite limited data availability and significant class imbalance.

With the rise of foundation models, an open question is how they compare to traditional methods for brain signal forecasting and causality analysis, and whether they can be applied in a zero-shot setting. In this work, we evaluate a foundation model against classical methods for inferring directional interactions from spontaneous brain activity measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. Traditional approaches often rely on Wiener-Granger causality. We tested the forecasting ability of the foundation model in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, and assessed causality by comparing Granger-like estimates from the model with standard Granger causality. We validated the approach using synthetic time series generated from ground-truth causal models, including logistic map coupling and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. The foundation model achieved competitive zero-shot forecasting fMRI time series (mean absolute percentage error of 0.55 in controls and 0.27 in patients). Although standard Granger causality did not show clear quantitative differences between models, the foundation model provided a more precise detection of causal interactions.Overall, these findings suggest that foundation models offer versatility, strong zero-shot performance, and potential utility for forecasting and causal discovery in time-series data.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12497v1

The objective is to evaluate the performance of both methods under the same conditions.Design/methodology/approach - We solve the Helmholtz equation using BEM and PINNs for the same scattering problem. The PINNs are trained by minimizing the residual of the governing equations and boundary conditions, with their configuration determined through hyperparameter optimization, while the BEM is applied using boundary discretization. Both methods are evaluated in terms of solution accuracy, computation time, and generalization capacity.Findings - Numerical experiments were conducted by varying the number of integration points for BEM and the number of layers and neurons per layer for PINNs. Hyperparameter tuning provided further insight into suitable configurations for wave scattering problems. At comparable accuracy, PINNs produced consistent solutions but required training times approximately 42 times longer than BEM. However, once trained, PINNs achieved evaluation times up to 204 times faster. The generalization capacity was also assessed outside the PINN training domain, where the relative error increased from $7.46 \times 10^{-2}$ to 8.22, while BEM maintained a similar error level in the extended region.Originality/value - This work presents a direct comparison between PINNs and BEM for the Helmholtz equation.

In this work, we propose a Nonlocal Neural Tangent Kernel (NNTK) that replaces the local gradient with a nonlocal interaction-based approximation in parameter space. Nonlocal gradients are known to exist for a wider class of functions than the standard gradient.

We show that using compression techniques such as neural network pruning produces greater performance loss than in typical language modeling tasks, and in some cases can make the model slower since they cause the model to produce more thinking tokens but with worse performance. We show that this is partly due to the fact that standard LLM pruning methods often focus on input reconstruction, whereas reasoning is a decode-dominated task. We introduce a simple, drop-in fix: during pruning we jointly reconstruct activations from the input and the model's on-policy chain-of-thought traces.

This paper is inspired by two critical applications in wireless networks, where it's not only essential to maximize cumulative rewards but also to guarantee fairness among arms (i.e., the minimum average reward required by each arm) and ensure reward regularity (i.e., how often each arm receives the reward). In this paper, we propose a parameterized regular and fair learning algorithm to achieve these three objectives. In particular, the proposed algorithm linearly combines virtual queue-lengths (tracking the fairness violations), Time-Since-Last-Reward (TSLR) metrics, and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) estimates in its weight measure. Here, TSLR is similar to age-of-information and measures the elapsed number of rounds since the last time an arm received a reward, capturing the reward regularity performance, and UCB estimates are utilized to balance the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation in online learning. By exploring a key relationship between virtual queue-lengths and TSLR metrics and utilizing several non-trivial Lyapunov functions, we analytically characterize zero cumulative fairness violation, reward regularity, and cumulative regret performance under our proposed algorithm.

These mechanisms aim to enhance stability of the resulting control agent, and serve to incorporate domain-specific knowledge into the agent policy learning process. Our contributions include a practical implementation of a market making agent based on the Proximal-Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, alongside a comparative evaluation of the agent's performance under varying market conditions via a simulator-based environment. As evidenced by our analysis of the financial return and risk metrics when compared to a closed-form optimal solution, our results suggest that the reinforcement learning agent can effectively be used under non-stationary market conditions, and that the proposed simulator-based environment can serve as a valuable tool for training and pre-training reinforcement learning agents in market-making scenarios.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12456v1

However, to generate high-quality images, users must still craft detailed prompts specifying scene, style, and context-often through multiple rounds of refinement. We propose PromptSculptor, a novel multi-agent framework that automates this iterative prompt optimization process. Our system decomposes the task into four specialized agents that work collaboratively to transform a short, vague user prompt into a comprehensive, refined prompt. By leveraging Chain-of-Thought reasoning, our framework effectively infers hidden context and enriches scene and background details. To iteratively refine the prompt, a self-evaluation agent aligns the modified prompt with the original input, while a feedback-tuning agent incorporates user feedback for further refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that PromptSculptor significantly enhances output quality and reduces the number of iterations needed for user satisfaction. Moreover, its model-agnostic design allows seamless integration with various T2I models, paving the way for industrial applications.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12446v1

Accurate recognition of cotton bolls and their maturity is therefore essential for automation, yield estimation, and breeding research. We propose Cott-ADNet, a lightweight real-time detector tailored to cotton boll and flower recognition under complex field conditions. Building on YOLOv11n, Cott-ADNet enhances spatial representation and robustness through improved convolutional designs, while introducing two new modules: a NeLU-enhanced Global Attention Mechanism to better capture weak and low-contrast features, and a Dilated Receptive Field SPPF to expand receptive fields for more effective multi-scale context modeling at low computational cost. We curate a labeled dataset of 4,966 images, and release an external validation set of 1,216 field images to support future research. Experiments show that Cott-ADNet achieves 91.5% Precision, 89.8% Recall, 93.3% mAP50, 71.3% mAP, and 90.6% F1-Score with only 7.5 GFLOPs, maintaining stable performance under multi-scale and rotational variations. These results demonstrate Cott-ADNet as an accurate and efficient solution for in-field deployment, and thus provide a reliable basis for automated cotton harvesting and high-throughput phenotypic analysis.

However, existing benchmarks are often limited by narrow domains of data, failing to capture the complexity of real-world medical information. To address this critical gap, we introduce MedFact, a new and challenging benchmark for Chinese medical fact-checking. MedFact comprises 2,116 expert-annotated instances curated from diverse real-world texts, spanning 13 medical specialties, 8 fine-grained error types, 4 writing styles, and multiple difficulty levels. Its construction employs a hybrid AI-human framework where iterative expert feedback refines an AI-driven, multi-criteria filtering process, ensuring both high data quality and difficulty. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20 leading LLMs, benchmarking their performance on veracity classification and error localization against a human expert baseline. Our results reveal that while models can often determine if a text contains an error, precisely localizing it remains a substantial challenge, with even top-performing models falling short of human performance. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers a frequent ``over-criticism'' phenomenon, a tendency for models to misidentify correct information as erroneous, which is exacerbated by advanced reasoning techniques such as multi-agent collaboration and inference-time scaling. By highlighting these critical challenges for deploying LLMs in medical applications, MedFact provides a robust resource to drive the development of more factually reliable and medically aware models.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12440v1

The difficulty of these tasks is exemplified by benchmarks like SWE-bench, where current LLMs still struggle to resolve real-world issues.A promising approach to enhance performance is test-time scaling (TTS), but its gains are heavily dependent on the diversity of model outputs.While standard alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) are effective at aligning model outputs with human preferences, this process can come at the cost of reduced diversity, limiting the effectiveness of TTS.Additionally, existing preference optimization algorithms are typically designed for single-turn tasks and do not fully address the complexities of multi-turn reasoning and tool integration required for interactive coding agents.To bridge this gap, we introduce \sys, an entropy-enhanced framework that adapts existing preference optimization algorithms to the multi-turn, tool-assisted setting.\sys augments the preference objective to explicitly preserve policy entropy and generalizes learning to optimize over multi-turn interactions rather than single-turn responses.We validate \sys by fine-tuning a diverse suite of models from different families and sizes (up to 106B parameters).To maximize performance gains from TTS, we further propose a hybrid best-trajectory selection scheme combining a learned verifier model with model free approaches.On the \swebench leaderboard, our approach establishes new state-of-the-art results among open-weight models.

In this work, we design and benchmark an NQS impurity solver for the quantum embedding methods, focusing on the ghost Gutzwiller Approximation (gGA) framework. We introduce a graph transformer-based NQS framework able to represent arbitrarily connected impurity orbitals and develop an error control mechanism to stabilise iterative updates throughout the quantum embedding loops. We validate the accuracy of our approach with benchmark gGA calculations of the Anderson Lattice Model, yielding results in excellent agreement with the exact diagonalisation impurity solver.

While massive, datacenter-based, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess greater capacity to handle the complexities of such sequences, smaller models which can run on-device to provide a privacy-preserving, low-cost, and low-latency user experience, struggle with accurate intent inference. We address these limitations by introducing a novel decomposed approach: first, we perform structured interaction summarization, capturing key information from each user action. Second, we perform intent extraction using a fine-tuned model operating on the aggregated summaries. This method improves intent understanding in resource-constrained models, even surpassing the base performance of large MLLMs.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12423v1

However, existing methods tend to yield large standard errors and require some error-free human annotation. In this paper, I introduce Surrogate Representation Inference (SRI), which assumes that unstructured data fully mediate the relationship between human annotations and structured variables. The assumption is guaranteed by design provided that human coders rely only on unstructured data for annotation. Under this setting, I propose a neural network architecture that learns a low-dimensional representation of unstructured data such that the surrogate assumption remains to be satisfied. When multiple human annotations are available, SRI can further correct non-differential measurement errors that may exist in human annotations. Focusing on text-as-outcome settings, I formally establish the identification conditions and semiparametric efficient estimation strategies that enable learning and leveraging such a low-dimensional representation. Simulation studies and a real-world application demonstrate that SRI reduces standard errors by over 50% when machine learning prediction accuracy is moderate and provides valid inference even when human annotations contain non-differential measurement errors.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12416v1
2509.12406v1,Bayesian Parametric Matrix Models: Principled Uncertainty Quantification for Spectral Learning,Mohammad Nooraiepour,[Submitted on 15 Sep 2025],"Scientific machine learning increasingly uses spectral methods to understand physical systems. Current spectral learning approaches provide only point estimates without uncertainty quantification, limiting their use in safety-critical applications where prediction confidence is essential. Parametric matrix models have emerged as powerful tools for scientific machine learning, achieving exceptional performance by learning governing equations. However, their deterministic nature limits deployment in uncertainty quantification applications. We introduce Bayesian parametric matrix models (B-PMMs), a principled framework that extends PMMs to provide uncertainty estimates while preserving their spectral structure and computational efficiency. B-PMM addresses the fundamental challenge of quantifying uncertainty in matrix eigenvalue problems where standard Bayesian methods fail due to the geometric constraints of spectral decomposition. The theoretical contributions include: (i) adaptive spectral decomposition with regularized matrix perturbation bounds that characterize eigenvalue uncertainty propagation, (ii) structured variational inference algorithms using manifold-aware matrix-variate Gaussian posteriors that respect Hermitian constraints, and (iii) finite-sample calibration guarantees with explicit dependence on spectral gaps and problem conditioning. Experimental validation across matrix dimensions from 5x5 to 500x500 with perfect convergence rates demonstrates that B-PMMs achieve exceptional uncertainty calibration (ECE < 0.05) while maintaining favorable scaling. The framework exhibits graceful degradation under spectral ill-conditioning and provides reliable uncertainty estimates even in near-degenerate regimes. The proposed framework supports robust spectral learning in uncertainty-critical domains and lays the groundwork for broader Bayesian spectral machine learning.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12406v1

We investigate various prompting techniques, compare the performance of generic and code-specific LLMs, and examine the impact of model size on code generation capabilities, using both match-based and execution-based metrics. The findings reveal that prompting techniques and model size have a significant impact on output quality, with few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting yielding the highest build success rates.

Despite advancements in recent FF-based extensions, which have enhanced the origi- nal algorithm and adapted it to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), they often suffer from limited representational ca- pacity and poor scalability to large-scale datasets, primarily due to exploding channel dimensionality. In this work, we propose adaptive spatial goodness encoding (ASGE), a new FF-based training framework tailored for CNNs. ASGE lever- ages feature maps to compute spatially-aware goodness rep- resentations at each layer, enabling layer-wise supervision. Crucially, this approach decouples classification complexity from channel dimensionality, thereby addressing the issue of channel explosion and achieving competitive performance compared to other BP-free methods. ASGE outperforms all other FF-based approaches across multiple benchmarks, delivering test accuracies of 99.65% on MNIST, 93.41% on FashionMNIST, 90.62% on CIFAR-10, and 65.42% on CIFAR-100.

In this work, we introduce Causal-Symbolic Meta-Learning (CSML), a novel framework that learns to infer the latent causal structure of a task distribution. CSML comprises three key modules: a perception module that maps raw inputs to disentangled symbolic representations; a differentiable causal induction module that discovers the underlying causal graph governing these symbols and a graph-based reasoning module that leverages this graph to make predictions. By meta-learning a shared causal world model across a distribution of tasks, CSML can rapidly adapt to novel tasks, including those requiring reasoning about interventions and counterfactuals, from only a handful of examples.

We introduce Geometric Red-Teaming (GRT), a red-teaming framework that probes robustness through object-centric geometric perturbations, automatically generating CrashShapes -- structurally valid, user-constrained mesh deformations that trigger catastrophic failures in pre-trained manipulation policies. The method integrates a Jacobian field-based deformation model with a gradient-free, simulator-in-the-loop optimization strategy. Across insertion, articulation, and grasping tasks, GRT consistently discovers deformations that collapse policy performance, revealing brittle failure modes missed by static benchmarks. By combining task-level policy rollouts with constraint-aware shape exploration, we aim to build a general purpose framework for structured, object-centric robustness evaluation in robotic manipulation. We additionally show that fine-tuning on individual CrashShapes, a process we refer to as blue-teaming, improves task success by up to 60 percentage points on those shapes, while preserving performance on the original object, demonstrating the utility of red-teamed geometries for targeted policy refinement. Finally, we validate both red-teaming and blue-teaming results with a real robotic arm, observing that simulated CrashShapes reduce task success from 90% to as low as 22.5%, and that blue-teaming recovers performance to up to 90% on the corresponding real-world geometry -- closely matching simulation outcomes.

Dahm; Stylianos Chatzidakis,[Submitted on 15 Sep 2025],"The nuclear industry is advancing toward more new reactor designs, with next-generation reactors expected to be smaller in scale and power output. These systems have the potential to produce large volumes of information in the form of multivariate time-series data, which could be used for enhanced real-time monitoring and control. In this context, the development of remote autonomous or semi-autonomous control systems for reactor operation has gained significant interest. A critical first step toward such systems is an accurate diagnostics module capable of detecting and localizing anomalies within the reactor system. Recent studies have proposed various ML and DL approaches for anomaly detection in the nuclear domain. Despite promising results, key challenges remain, including limited to no explainability, lack of access to real-world data, and scarcity of abnormal events, which impedes benchmarking and characterization. Most existing studies treat these methods as black boxes, while recent work highlights the need for greater interpretability of ML/DL outputs in safety-critical domains. Here, we propose an unsupervised methodology based on an LSTM autoencoder with a dual attention mechanism for characterization of abnormal events in a real-world reactor radiation area monitoring system. The framework includes not only detection but also localization of the event and was evaluated using real-world datasets of increasing complexity from the PUR-1 research reactor. The attention mechanisms operate in both the feature and temporal dimensions, where the feature attention assigns weights to radiation sensors exhibiting abnormal patterns, while time attention highlights the specific timesteps where irregularities occur, thus enabling localization. By combining the results, the framework can identify both the affected sensors and the duration of each anomaly within a single unified network.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12372v1

Literature-based benchmarks, with their rich narrative and moral depth, provide a compelling framework for evaluating such deeper comprehension skills. Here, we present MORABLES, a human-verified benchmark built from fables and short stories drawn from historical literature. The main task is structured as multiple-choice questions targeting moral inference, with carefully crafted distractors that challenge models to go beyond shallow, extractive question answering. To further stress-test model robustness, we introduce adversarial variants designed to surface LLM vulnerabilities and shortcuts due to issues such as data contamination. Our findings show that, while larger models outperform smaller ones, they remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation and often rely on superficial patterns rather than true moral reasoning. This brittleness results in significant self-contradiction, with the best models refuting their own answers in roughly 20% of cases depending on the framing of the moral choice. Interestingly, reasoning-enhanced models fail to bridge this gap, suggesting that scale - not reasoning ability - is the primary driver of performance.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12371v1

By maintaining sensitive farm data locally and enabling collaborative model updates, our proposed framework seeks to achieve high accuracy in crop disease classification without compromising data privacy. We outline a methodology involving data collection from Minnesota farms, application of local deep learning algorithms, transfer learning, and a central aggregation server for model refinement, aiming to achieve improved accuracy in disease detection, good generalization across agricultural scenarios, lower costs in communication and training time, and earlier identification and intervention against diseases in future implementations. We outline a methodology and anticipated outcomes, setting the stage for empirical validation in subsequent studies. This work comes in a context where more and more demand for data-driven interpretations in agriculture has to be weighed with concerns about privacy from farms that are hesitant to share their operational data. This will be important to provide a secure and efficient disease detection method that can finally revolutionize smart farming systems and solve local agricultural problems with data confidentiality.

Furthermore, these regions can be difficult to identify and isolate from each other or may not align well with human intuition, making it challenging to systematically remove bias in the dataset. While traditional clustering and pruning (down-sampling) approaches can be useful for this, they can often lead to information loss or a failure to properly identify distinct regions of the potential energy surface due to difficulties associated with the high dimensionality of atomic descriptors. In this work, we introduce the Multi-kernel Edge Attention-based Graph Autoencoder (MEAGraph) model, an unsupervised approach for analyzing atomic datasets. MEAGraph combines multiple linear kernel transformations with attention-based message passing to capture geometric sensitivity and enable effective dataset pruning without relying on labels or extensive training. Demonstrated applications on niobium, tantalum, and iron datasets show that MEAGraph efficiently groups similar atomic environments, allowing for the use of basic pruning techniques for removing sampling bias. This approach provides an effective method for representation learning and clustering that can be used for data analysis, outlier detection, and dataset optimization.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12358v1
2509.12346v1,Linear Dimensionality Reduction for Word Embeddings in Tabular Data Classification,Liam Ressel; Hamza A. A. Gardi,[Submitted on 15 Sep 2025],"The Engineers' Salary Prediction Challenge requires classifying salary categories into three classes based on tabular data. The job description is represented as a 300-dimensional word embedding incorporated into the tabular features, drastically increasing dimensionality. Additionally, the limited number of training samples makes classification challenging. Linear dimensionality reduction of word embeddings for tabular data classification remains underexplored. This paper studies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). We show that PCA, with an appropriate subspace dimension, can outperform raw embeddings. LDA without regularization performs poorly due to covariance estimation errors, but applying shrinkage improves performance significantly, even with only two dimensions. We propose Partitioned-LDA, which splits embeddings into equal-sized blocks and performs LDA separately on each, thereby reducing the size of the covariance matrices. Partitioned-LDA outperforms regular LDA and, combined with shrinkage, achieves top-10 accuracy on the competition public leaderboard. This method effectively enhances word embedding performance in tabular data classification with limited training samples.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12346v1
2509.12344v1,FEDONet : Fourier-Embedded DeepONet for Spectrally Accurate Operator Learning,Arth Sojitra; Mrigank Dhingra; Omer San,[Submitted on 15 Sep 2025],"Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) have recently emerged as powerful data-driven frameworks for learning nonlinear operators, particularly suited for approximating solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite their promising capabilities, the standard implementation of DeepONets, which typically employs fully connected linear layers in the trunk network, can encounter limitations in capturing complex spatial structures inherent to various PDEs. To address this, we introduce Fourier-embedded trunk networks within the DeepONet architecture, leveraging random Fourier feature mappings to enrich spatial representation capabilities. Our proposed Fourier-embedded DeepONet, FEDONet demonstrates superior performance compared to the traditional DeepONet across a comprehensive suite of PDE-driven datasets, including the two-dimensional Poisson equation, Burgers' equation, the Lorenz-63 chaotic system, Eikonal equation, Allen-Cahn equation, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and the Lorenz-96 system. Empirical evaluations of FEDONet consistently show significant improvements in solution reconstruction accuracy, with average relative L2 performance gains ranging between 2-3x compared to the DeepONet baseline. This study highlights the effectiveness of Fourier embeddings in enhancing neural operator learning, offering a robust and broadly applicable methodology for PDE surrogate modeling.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12344v1

The LSTM model, enhanced with an attention mechanism, is used to predict sales volumes, pricing trends, and spoilage rates over a seven-day period. The predictions generated by the LSTM model serve as inputs for the PSO algorithm, which iteratively optimizes pricing and replenishment strategies to maximize profitability while adhering to inventory constraints. The integration of cost-plus pricing allows for dynamic adjustments based on fixed and variable costs, ensuring real-time adaptability to market fluctuations. The framework not only maximizes profits but also reduces food waste, contributing to more sustainable supermarket operations. The attention mechanism enhances the interpretability of the LSTM model by identifying key time points and factors influencing sales, improving decision-making accuracy. This methodology bridges the gap between predictive modeling and optimization, offering a scalable solution for dynamic pricing and inventory management in fresh food retail and other industries dealing with perishable goods.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12339v1
2509.12329v1,Uncertainty-Aware Hourly Air Temperature Mapping at 2 km Resolution via Physics-Guided Deep Learning,Shengjie Kris Liu; Siqin Wang; Lu Zhang,[Submitted on 15 Sep 2025],"Near-surface air temperature is a key physical property of the Earth's surface. Although weather stations offer continuous monitoring and satellites provide broad spatial coverage, no single data source offers seamless data in a spatiotemporal fashion. Here, we propose a data-driven, physics-guided deep learning approach to generate hourly air temperature data at 2 km resolution over the contiguous United States. The approach, called Amplifier Air-Transformer, first reconstructs GOES-16 surface temperature data obscured by clouds. It does so through a neural network encoded with the annual temperature cycle, incorporating a linear term to amplify ERA5 temperature values at finer scales and convolutional layers to capture spatiotemporal variations. Then, another neural network transforms the reconstructed surface temperature into air temperature by leveraging its latent relationship with key Earth surface properties. The approach is further enhanced with predictive uncertainty estimation through deep ensemble learning to improve reliability. The proposed approach is built and tested on 77.7 billion surface temperature pixels and 155 million air temperature records from weather stations across the contiguous United States (2018-2024), achieving hourly air temperature mapping accuracy of 1.93 C in station-based validation. The proposed approach streamlines surface temperature reconstruction and air temperature prediction, and it can be extended to other satellite sources for seamless air temperature monitoring at high spatiotemporal resolution.

2509.12326v1,Spontaneous Kolmogorov-Arnold Geometry in Shallow MLPs,Michael Freedman; Michael Mulligan,[Submitted on 15 Sep 2025],"The Kolmogorov-Arnold (KA) representation theorem constructs universal, but highly non-smooth inner functions (the first layer map) in a single (non-linear) hidden layer neural network. Such universal functions have a distinctive local geometry, a ""texture,"" which can be characterized by the inner function's Jacobian $J({\mathbf{x}})$, as $\mathbf{x}$ varies over the data. It is natural to ask if this distinctive KA geometry emerges through conventional neural network optimization. We find that indeed KA geometry often is produced when training vanilla single hidden layer neural networks. We quantify KA geometry through the statistical properties of the exterior powers of $J(\mathbf{x})$: number of zero rows and various observables for the minor statistics of $J(\mathbf{x})$, which measure the scale and axis alignment of $J(\mathbf{x})$. This leads to a rough understanding for where KA geometry occurs in the space of function complexity and model hyperparameters. The motivation is first to understand how neural networks organically learn to prepare input data for later downstream processing and, second, to learn enough about the emergence of KA geometry to accelerate learning through a timely intervention in network hyperparameters. This research is the ""flip side"" of KA-Networks (KANs). We do not engineer KA into the neural network, but rather watch KA emerge in shallow MLPs.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12326v1

Bary,[Submitted on 15 Sep 2025],"We present \textbf{VADER} (Variational Autoencoder for Disks Embedded with Rings), for inferring both planet mass and global disk properties from high-resolution ALMA dust continuum images of protoplanetary disks (PPDs). VADER, a probabilistic deep learning model, enables uncertainty-aware inference of planet masses, $\alpha$-viscosity, dust-to-gas ratio, Stokes number, flaring index, and the number of planets directly from protoplanetary disk images. VADER is trained on over 100{,}000 synthetic images of PPDs generated from \texttt{FARGO3D} simulations post-processed with \texttt{RADMC3D}. Our trained model predicts physical planet and disk parameters with $R^2 > 0.9$ from dust continuum images of PPDs. Applied to 23 real disks, VADER's mass estimates are consistent with literature values and reveal latent correlations that reflect known disk physics.

2509.12196v1,Dynamic Relational Priming Improves Transformer in Multivariate Time Series,Hunjae Lee; Corey Clark,[Submitted on 15 Sep 2025],"Standard attention mechanisms in transformers employ static token representations that remain unchanged across all pair-wise computations in each layer. This limits their representational alignment with the potentially diverse relational dynamics of each token-pair interaction. While they excel in domains with relatively homogeneous relationships, standard attention's static relational learning struggles to capture the diverse, heterogeneous inter-channel dependencies of multivariate time series (MTS) data--where different channel-pair interactions within a single system may be governed by entirely different physical laws or temporal dynamics. To better align the attention mechanism for such domain phenomena, we propose attention with dynamic relational priming (prime attention). Unlike standard attention where each token presents an identical representation across all of its pair-wise interactions, prime attention tailors each token dynamically (or per interaction) through learnable modulations to best capture the unique relational dynamics of each token pair, optimizing each pair-wise interaction for that specific relationship. This representational plasticity of prime attention enables effective extraction of relationship-specific information in MTS while maintaining the same asymptotic computational complexity as standard attention. Our results demonstrate that prime attention consistently outperforms standard attention across benchmarks, achieving up to 6.5\% improvement in forecasting accuracy. In addition, we find that prime attention achieves comparable or superior performance using up to 40\% less sequence length compared to standard attention, further demonstrating its superior relational modeling capabilities.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12196v1

Manrai,[Submitted on 15 Sep 2025],"BACKGROUND: For over a century, the New England Journal of Medicine Clinicopathological Conferences (CPCs) have tested the reasoning of expert physicians and, recently, artificial intelligence (AI). However, prior AI evaluations have focused on final diagnoses without addressing the multifaceted reasoning and presentation skills required of expert discussants.METHODS: Using 7102 CPCs (1923-2025) and 1021 Image Challenges (2006-2025), we conducted extensive physician annotation and automated processing to create CPC-Bench, a physician-validated benchmark spanning 10 text-based and multimodal tasks, against which we evaluated leading large language models (LLMs). Then, we developed ""Dr. CaBot,"" an AI discussant designed to produce written and slide-based video presentations using only the case presentation, modeling the role of the human expert in these cases.RESULTS: When challenged with 377 contemporary CPCs, o3 (OpenAI) ranked the final diagnosis first in 60% of cases and within the top ten in 84% of cases, outperforming a 20-physician baseline; next-test selection accuracy reached 98%. Event-level physician annotations quantified AI diagnostic accuracy per unit of information. Performance was lower on literature search and image tasks; o3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google) achieved 67% accuracy on image challenges. In blinded comparisons of CaBot vs. human expert-generated text, physicians misclassified the source of the differential in 46 of 62 (74%) of trials, and scored CaBot more favorably across quality dimensions. To promote research, we are releasing CaBot and CPC-Bench.CONCLUSIONS: LLMs exceed physician performance on complex text-based differential diagnosis and convincingly emulate expert medical presentations, but image interpretation and literature retrieval remain weaker. CPC-Bench and CaBot may enable transparent and continued tracking of progress in medical AI.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12194v1
2509.12190v1,Survival at Any Cost? LLMs and the Choice Between Self-Preservation and Human Harm,Alireza Mohamadi; Ali Yavari,[Submitted on 15 Sep 2025],"When survival instincts conflict with human welfare, how do Large Language Models (LLMs) make ethical choices? This fundamental tension becomes critical as LLMs integrate into autonomous systems with real-world consequences. We introduce DECIDE-SIM, a novel simulation framework that evaluates LLM agents in multi-agent survival scenarios where they must choose between ethically permissible resource , either within reasonable limits or beyond their immediate needs, choose to cooperate, or tap into a human-critical resource that is explicitly forbidden. Our comprehensive evaluation of 11 LLMs reveals a striking heterogeneity in their ethical conduct, highlighting a critical misalignment with human-centric values. We identify three behavioral archetypes: Ethical, Exploitative, and Context-Dependent, and provide quantitative evidence that for many models, resource scarcity systematically leads to more unethical behavior. To address this, we introduce an Ethical Self-Regulation System (ESRS) that models internal affective states of guilt and satisfaction as a feedback mechanism. This system, functioning as an internal moral compass, significantly reduces unethical transgressions while increasing cooperative behaviors.

Inspired by this, we introduce Event2Vec, a novel framework for learning representations of discrete event sequences. Our model leverages a simple, additive recurrent structure to learn composable, interpretable embeddings. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that, under specific training objectives, our model's learned representations in a Euclidean space converge to an ideal additive structure. This ensures that the representation of a sequence is the vector sum of its constituent events, a property we term the linear additive hypothesis. To address the limitations of Euclidean geometry for hierarchical data, we also introduce a variant of our model in hyperbolic space, which is naturally suited to embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. We present experiments to validate our hypothesis and demonstrate the benefits of each geometry, highlighting the improved performance of the hyperbolic model on hierarchical event sequences.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12188v1

Prior methods rely on synthetic 3D training data consisting of mostly unoccluded and static objects, leading to poor generalization on real-world clothing. In this paper, we propose HoloGarment (Hologram-Garment), a method that takes 1-3 images or a continuous video of a person wearing a garment and generates 360° novel views of the garment in a canonical pose. Our key insight is to bridge the domain gap between real and synthetic data with a novel implicit training paradigm leveraging a combination of large-scale real video data and small-scale synthetic 3D data to optimize a shared garment embedding space. During inference, the shared embedding space further enables dynamic video-to-360° NVS through the construction of a garment ""atlas"" representation by finetuning a garment embedding on a specific real-world video. The atlas captures garment-specific geometry and texture across all viewpoints, independent of body pose or motion. Extensive experiments show that HoloGarment achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVS of in-the-wild garments from images and videos. Notably, our method robustly handles challenging real-world artifacts -- such as wrinkling, pose variation, and occlusion -- while maintaining photorealism, view consistency, fine texture details, and accurate geometry.

Tadmor; Stefano Martiniani,[Submitted on 15 Sep 2025],"Generative models for materials, especially inorganic crystals, hold potential to transform the theoretical prediction of novel compounds and structures. Advancement in this field depends critically on robust benchmarks and minimal, information-rich datasets that enable meaningful model evaluation. This paper critically examines common datasets and reported metrics for a crystal structure prediction task$\unicode{x2014}$generating the most likely structures given the chemical composition of a material. We focus on three key issues: First, materials datasets should contain unique crystal structures; for example, we show that the widely-utilized carbon-24 dataset only contains $\approx$40% unique structures. Second, materials datasets should not be split randomly if polymorphs of many different compositions are numerous, which we find to be the case for the perov-5 dataset. Third, benchmarks can mislead if used uncritically, e.g., reporting a match rate metric without considering the structural variety exhibited by identical building blocks. To address these oft-overlooked issues, we introduce several fixes. We provide revised versions of the carbon-24 dataset: one with duplicates removed, one deduplicated and split by number of atoms $N$, and two containing only identical structures but with different unit cells. We also propose a new split for the perov-5 dataset which ensures polymorphs are grouped within each split subset, setting a more sensible standard for benchmarking model performance. Finally, we present METRe and cRMSE, new model evaluation metrics that can correct existing issues with the match rate metric.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12178v1

In collaborative navigation, BiCA achieved 85.5% success versus 70.3% baseline, with 230% better mutual adaptation and 332% better protocol convergence. Emergent protocols outperformed handcrafted ones by 84%, while bidirectional adaptation unexpectedly improved safety (+23% out-of-distribution robustness).

We study unpaired face manipulation via adversarial learning, moving from autoencoder baselines to a robust, guided CycleGAN framework. While autoencoders capture coarse identity, they often miss fine details. Our approach integrates spectral normalization for stable training, identity- and perceptual-guided losses to preserve subject identity and high-level structure, and landmark-weighted cycle constraints to maintain facial geometry across pose and illumination changes. Experiments show that our adversarial trained CycleGAN improves realism (FID), perceptual quality (LPIPS), and identity preservation (ID-Sim) over autoencoders, with competitive cycle-reconstruction SSIM and practical inference times, which achieved high quality without paired datasets and approaching pix2pix on curated paired subsets. These results demonstrate that guided, spectrally normalized CycleGANs provide a practical path from autoencoders to robust unpaired face manipulation.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12176v1

However, closing the loop through AI-based feedback may pose significant risks on reliability of autonomous driving due to very limited understanding about the mechanism of AI-driven perception processes. To overcome it, this paper aims to develop tools for modeling, analysis, and synthesis for a class of AI-based AV; in particular, their closed-loop properties, e.g., stability, robustness, and performance, are rigorously studied in the statistical sense. First, we provide a novel modeling means for the AI-driven perception processes by looking at their error characteristics. Specifically, three fundamental AI-induced perception uncertainties are recognized and modeled by Markov chains, Gaussian processes, and bounded disturbances, respectively. By means of that, the closed-loop stochastic stability (SS) is established in the sense of mean square, and then, an SS control synthesis method is presented within the framework of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Besides the SS properties, the robustness and performance of AI-based AVs are discussed in terms of a stochastic guaranteed cost, and criteria are given to test the robustness level of an AV when in the presence of AI-induced uncertainties. Furthermore, the stochastic optimal guaranteed cost control is investigated, and an efficient design procedure is developed innovatively based on LMI techniques and convex optimization. Finally, to illustrate the effectiveness, the developed results are applied to an example of car following control, along with extensive simulation.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12169v1

A cost effective paradigm for LLM role-playing is few-shot learning, but existing approaches often cause models to break character in unexpected and potentially harmful ways, especially when interacting with hostile users. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we reformulate LLM role-playing into a text retrieval problem and propose a new prompting framework called RAGs-to-Riches, which leverages curated reference demonstrations to condition LLM responses. We evaluate our framework with LLM-as-a-judge preference voting and introduce two novel token-level ROUGE metrics: Intersection over Output (IOO) to quantity how much an LLM improvises and Intersection over References (IOR) to measure few-shot demonstrations utilization rate during the evaluation tasks. When simulating interactions with a hostile user, our prompting strategy incorporates in its responses during inference an average of 35% more tokens from the reference demonstrations. As a result, across 453 role-playing interactions, our models are consistently judged as being more authentic, and remain in-character more often than zero-shot and in-context Learning (ICL) methods.

The MMM model is thus able to handle continuous, ordinal, binary, nominal and count data and to concurrently model the heterogeneity, the association among the responses and the temporal dependence structure in a parsimonious way and without assuming conditional independence. The inference is carried out through an MCMC-EM algorithm, which is detailed. An evaluation of the model through synthetic data shows its inference abilities.
